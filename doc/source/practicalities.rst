Practical matters
=================

Lecturer
--------

The module is led by `Prof Colin Cotter
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_, a Professor of
Computational Mathematics. He researches computational methods for
atmosphere and ocean modelling (as well as other geophysical fluid
models), computational image registration, data assimilation and
a collection of other things that require numerical algorithms and
discretisations. Computational linear algebra tools form part of
his day-to-day research work.

Accreditation
-------------

This module is an accredited elective for third and fourth year
mathematics and JMC undergraduates. It is also approved for the `MSc
in Applied Mathematics
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/courses/mathematics/applied-mathematics/>`_. Other
masters and PhD students wishing to take the module should contact the
course lecturer in the first instance.

Assumed knowledge
-----------------

The theory component of the module will assume only a familiarity with
undergraduate linear algebra. The implementation will be in Python, a
very high level and simple language with similarities to
Matlab. Students who are not familiar with Python will need to acquire
some familiarity with the language, for example by doing one of the
suggested tutorials. We won't use that many features of Python though,
mainly just functions and loops.


Assessment
----------

The module will be assessed by submission of three courseworks, each
comprising a pdf report and a code submission. The first will be worth
20%, with feedback provided to students that they can use to help with
the second and third courseworks, worth 40% each.

Mastery
.......

All Department of Mathematics fourth year and masters courses must
contain a mastery component. This part of the course is only for
completion by those students: third year students are exempt.
The mastery component of this module will be an additional
coursework based on additional material.

Blackboard
----------

Important announcements and the coursework submission will be conducted
via Blackboard. Please ensure you are enrolled in this module on Blackboard!
