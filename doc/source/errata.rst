Errata for 2022/23
==================

Here we'll list all the updates to the exercises and coursework Classroom
repositories for Autumn 2022. An up to date version is in the
`public repository <https://github.com/comp-lin-alg/comp-lin-alg-course>`_.

* Exercises 2.4 and 2.5: the tests expect you to change the array
  provided as input and not make a copy.

* Exercise 2.12 was updated as we don't need to use scipy anymore (because
  solve\_U was moved earlier.

* solveQ should be renamed to solve\_Q in test\_exercises1.test\_solveQ.

* Theorem 1.29 - replaced `Q\mapsto \hat{Q}`.

* Section 3.2 - removed `x'` from the FLOP count "derivation".

* After Definition 3.15 - `J=-x^{1/2}/2`.

* Theorem 4.12, adding a missing `\tilde{P}`.
